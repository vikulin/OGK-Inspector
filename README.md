|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|

**OGK Inspector** is the official Android companion app for [OpenGammaKit](https://github.com/vikulin/OpenGammaKit) spectrometers, designed to interface with supported hardware via USB serial (compatible with Android 7.0+). Built for high-precision diagnostics and calibration workflows, it now includes advanced signal processing tools such as Savitzky-Golay filtering and wavelet-based peak detection.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Counter Mode**  
  Real-time tracking of counts per second (CPS) for continuous monitoring.

- **Threshold Alerting**  
  Audible alarms and visual indicators when radiation thresholds are exceeded.

- **Real-Time Gamma Spectrum Visualization**  
  High-resolution spectrum plotting with dynamic chart updates and enhanced calibration accuracy.

- **Savitzky-Golay Filtering**  
  Polynomial smoothing applied to spectral data to reduce noise while preserving peak shape.

- **Wavelet-Based Peak Detection (CWT)**  
  Advanced peak detection using Continuous Wavelet Transform, including:
  - Multi-scale analysis
  - Automatic noise estimation
  - Peak grouping by proximity
  - Support for baseline correction

- **Spectrum Chart Screenshots**  
  Capture and save high-quality spectrum images directly on your device.

- **Android Share Integration**
